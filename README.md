 Testing Node Install\
Create a js file named main.js on your machine (Windows or Linux) having the following code.

/* Eugene’s First Application In Node */\
console.log("Hello, World!")

Now execute main.js file using Node.js interpreter to see the result -
<prompt>:  node main.js

If everything is fine with your installation, this should produce the following result -
Hello, World!

Testing Mongo Is Installed Right.\
Verify this is the correct location for your install.\
Then type in the following commands:\
c:\
cd\\
md data\
cd data\
md db\
cd\\
cd "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.2\bin"\
mongod

If everything is right, you should see a mongo screen that shows running status
